TL;DR
We are seeking 6,000 USD to position Qubic as a “Wagmi” sponsor of Web3Lagos Conference 2025, the largest Web3 gathering in Nigeria. This sponsorship tier provides main‑stage visibility, an on‑site booth, media presence, and networking opportunities, ideal for expanding our African community and generating qualified leads.
Over the past year we have actively prepared for an event of this scale, running multiple meetings (universities + crypto clubs) to deliver the best possible experience and gain a competitive edge. This conference will also act as a springboard for our upcoming goal of hosting a hackathon, remember, Nigeria accounts for ≈ 3 % of the world’s blockchain‑developer talent pool.
We deliberately opt for the lowest‑priced “Wagmi” package to prove to the quorum that we can achieve meaningful impact with limited resources.
Context
Web3Lagos Conference (Web3LC) is Nigeria’s flagship Web3 event: three days of hackathons, workshops, panels, and networking, with 2,400 + attendees in 2024 and 700,000 + X (Twitter) impressions.
The 2025 edition will take place in August 2025 at The Zone, Lagos, focusing on Technology, Community, and Education.
Africa’s Web3 ecosystem is growing rapidly; a presence in Lagos gives us access to a strategic emerging market and strengthens our brand across the continent.
“Wagmi” Opportunity (3,000 USD)
The “Wagmi” package includes:
10‑minute sponsor spotlight on the main stage.
3 ft × 4 ft table booth for all three days.
Two dedicated tweets from Web3Lagos accounts (June–August).
One dedicated Twitter Space + post‑event analytics report.
Newsletter feature in Web3Bridge (9 000 subscribers, 45 % open rate).
Invitation to the press conference with media partners.
Logo placement on livestream, stage backdrops, and all printed/digital assets.
